OUTPUT - 

array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

Explanation:

var arr1 = "john".split('');: This line creates an array arr1 by splitting the string "john" into individual characters. 

So, arr1 will be ['j', 'o', 'h', 'n'].

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();: This line reverses the order of elements in arr1 using the reverse() method. 

The reverse() method modifies the original array and also returns a reference to the same array. 

So, arr2 will be a reference to the same array as arr1, which is ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j'].

var arr3 = "jones".split('');: This line creates an array arr3 by splitting the string "jones" into individual characters. 

So, arr3 will be ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'].

arr2.push(arr3);: This line pushes the entire array arr3 as a single element into arr2. 

After this operation, arr2 will be ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j', ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']]. 

The array arr3 becomes the last element of arr2.

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));: 

This line logs the length of arr1, which is 5, and the last element of arr1, which is obtained using the slice() method with the argument -1. 

The slice(-1) method returns a new array containing the last element of the original array. 

Since the last element of arr1 is 's', the output will be array 1: length=5 last=s.

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));: 

This line logs the length of arr2, which is also 5, and the last element of arr2. 

As mentioned earlier, the last element of arr2 is the array arr3 itself, which is ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']. 

The output will be array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s.
