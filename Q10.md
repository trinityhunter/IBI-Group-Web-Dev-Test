Explanation:

console.log(1);: 

The number 1 will be logged first to the console, as it is a synchronous operation.

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);: 

This line schedules the printNumber function with the argument 2 to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

However, the delay of 0 milliseconds does not mean it will execute immediately. 

Instead, it will be added to the task queue after all the currently executing synchronous code is completed.

setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);: 

This line schedules the printNumber function with the argument 3 to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. 

It will also be added to the task queue, but after the previous setTimeout.

console.log(4);: The number 4 will be logged next to the console, as it is also a synchronous operation.
