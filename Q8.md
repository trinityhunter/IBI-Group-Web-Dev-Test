The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console when the code is executed, and they will appear in the following order:

1
4
3
2

Explanation:

console.log(1);: The number 1 will be logged first to the console immediately.
setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);: 
This line schedules the function to log 2 after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). 
During this 1-second delay, the JavaScript engine continues executing the next lines of code.
setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);: This line schedules the function to log 3 after a delay of 0 milliseconds. 
Although it has a delay of 0, it doesn't mean it will execute immediately. 
The reason is that JavaScript's event loop will first complete the current synchronous execution before handling the callback for the setTimeout function. 
Since we are currently inside an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), the entire function's execution will complete before the setTimeout callbacks are handled.
console.log(4);: 
The number 4 will be logged immediately after the number 1, as it's a synchronous operation.
So, the synchronous operations (1 and 4) will be logged first, followed by the scheduled asynchronous operations (3 and 2). 
Since the delay for logging 3 is 0 milliseconds, it will be executed after 1 and 4, but before 2, which has a delay of 1000 milliseconds. Thus, the numbers will be logged in the order mentioned above.
